The [openSUSE](https://get.opensuse.org/) Project is preparing to expand its hardware capabilities with a high-performance system designed to accelerate support for the next generation of processor architecture. 

As part of a collaboration between [SUSE](https://www.nvidia.com/) and [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/), a high-performance [NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip system](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-hopper-superchip/) is being shipped for use in the [openSUSE’s Build Service (OBS)](https://build.opensuse.org/) . This system will enable Armv9-based builds of [Tumbleweed](https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/). This is critical step in expanding the platform’s architecture reach and future-proofing its development infrastructure.

The collaboration reflects a shared commitment to open-source innovation and the need for cutting-edge build capabilities. The addition of the Grace Hopper aims to meet increasing performance demands in development and testing, reinforcing Tumbleweed’s value as a fast-moving platform within the open-source software ecosystem.

The Grace Hopper system, based on the [NVIDIA GH200 Superchip](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-hopper-superchip/), delivers a breakthrough unified CPU-GPU memory model with massive bandwidth and compute capabilities. 

This design is built for accelerated computing, large-scale artificial intelligence, and high-performance computing (HPC) applications, which makes it an ideal candidate for [OBS](https://build.opensuse.org/) as it targets [Armv9](https://www.arm.com/architecture/cpu/a-profile/armv9) optimizations.

Experts from both [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com)  and [Arm](https://www.arm.com/) identified the importance of native Armv9 hardware within OBS to fully realize potential performance gains and validate builds optimized for this architecture.. Tumbleweed is a natural candidate for experimentation on emerging hardware platforms and will improve build speeds for Arm-based architectures.

The GH200 system slated for deployment combines an Arm-based Grace CPU with a Hopper GPU, linked by NVIDIA’s NVLink-C2C interface. Unlike traditional setups that require constant memory copying between processing units, this architecture allows both processors to access data in place. The result is significantly faster compilation, reduced latency in complex workloads, and better efficiency across OBS pipelines.

The new system is expected to provide openSUSE contributors with faster package build times, lower energy consumption for long-running tasks, and an enhanced development experience—particularly for Armv9 targets.

The system is expected to arrive by the end of April 2025.

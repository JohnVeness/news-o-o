**The [Upgrade to Freedom](https://news.opensuse.org/category/upgrade-to-freedom) campaign has joined the [End of 10](https://endof10.org) initiative to promote Free and Open Source Software as a sustainable alternative to Windows 10. Learn more at [endof10.org](https://endof10.org).**

Creative professionals exploring alternatives that allow them to continue working without investing in costly new hardware and software upgrades can look at Linux as the end of Windows 10 approaches. 

Distributions and flavors like [openSUSE](https://get.opensuse.org/)’s [Tumbleweed](https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/), [Leap](https://get.opensuse.org/leap/), [Slowroll](https://en.opensuse.org/Archive:Old_Slowroll_Page), [Kalpa](https://get.opensuse.org/microos/) and [Aeon](https://aeondesktop.org) and other Linux distributions offer an excellent platform for creators with a wide variety of powerful, open-source tools designed to meet the needs of artists, designers, photographers, videographers and video editors. 

From Indie short films to podcasts, open-source software and tools are available as a [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/), [AppImage](https://appimage.org/) or as a native applications for creative people to create.

Many user-friendly tools are viable alternatives to popular, proprietary commercial applications like Photoshop, Illustrator, Final Cut Pro and others.

This article explores some of the top creative tools available on Linux and how transitioning to openSUSE can help creative professionals maintain, or even improve, their productivity.

**Transitioning from Photoshop to GIMP**

For many creatives, Photoshop is the go-to application for photo editing and graphic design. However, [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) is an excellent open-source alternative that provides a wide range of professional-grade features.

GIMP supports many file formats, including PSD and offers powerful tools for retouching, editing and manipulating images. Creative professionals will find familiar features like layers, masks, blending modes and a variety of brushes. GIMP also supports high-bit-depth images and allows users to create professional-quality designs.

GIMP may have a slightly different workflow than Photoshop, but it is flexible, customizable and its plugin support makes it a highly versatile tool for image editing and graphic design. Many users find that GIMP offers all the functionality they need to complete complex projects.

**Alternatives to Illustrator: Inkscape**

For vector graphics, [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) is a known alternative to Illustrator. Inkscape is a powerful, free tool for creating logos, illustrations and scalable graphics. It supports common vector formats, including SVG, AI, and EPS, which make it easy to integrate into existing workflows.

Inkscape’s interface is intuitive for Illustrator users and features many of the same tools, such as the Pen tool, curves, shape tools and layer management. Its active development community ensures frequent updates, and the software is highly customizable through extensions and plugins.

For those focused on scalable design and illustration, Inkscape provides a professional-grade environment without the subscription fees associated with cloud creative services. This saves costs and opens people’s minds to the alternatives that are available.

**Video Editing: Kdenlive and Blender**

Creative professionals working in video production and editing have strong options to use both [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/en/) and [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/en/), which is part of the [KDE](https://kde.org/) ecosystem, is a feature-rich video editor that provides tools for cutting, splitting and arranging video clips. It supports multiple video and audio tracks, transitions, effects and keyframe animation, which makes it suitable for everything from simple edits to more complex projects.

[Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is an industry-leading, open-source application meant for those working on 3D animation, video effects or visual effects (VFX). Blender’s capabilities include 3D modeling, animation, rendering and compositing, as well as a fully functional video editor. Blender is widely used in professional studios for film, game development and visual effects, which makes it a powerful option for creative professionals. Blender’s source code is governed by the GNU General Public License, embodying the same principles of freedom and collaboration that drives distributions like openSUSE and others. 

**Audio Production: Ardour and Audacity**

Creative professionals working in music production, sound design or podcasting have options. Software packages like [Ardour](https://ardour.org/) and [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) offer powerful audio editing solutions. Ardour is a digital audio workstation (DAW) that supports multi-track recording, mixing and mastering. It is widely used for professional audio production, supporting VST plugins and offers advanced feature sets comparable to Logic Pro and Pro Tools.

Audacity is a simple and easy-to-use tool for audio editing; it’s ideal for basic recording, podcasting and sound editing tasks. It’s perfect for quick edits and simple projects, with support for a variety of audio formats and built-in effects.

**3D Modeling and Animation: Blender**

Blender deserves a second mention here because of its dominance in the field of 3D modeling and animation. Blender's comprehensive suite of tools allows users to create everything from character animations to architectural models. It offers sculpting tools, UV unwrapping, rigging, particle simulation, and more.

For creative professionals used to proprietary 3D modeling software like Autodesk Maya or 3ds Max, Blender provides a comparable, if not superior, set of features with the added benefit of being open-source.

**Publishing and Layout: Scribus**

For professionals in publishing or those who need to create print-ready materials, [Scribus](https://www.scribus.net/) is a capable desktop publishing tool. It provides features for designing brochures, books, magazines and other print materials. It’s similar to InDesign and just as functional.

Scribus supports advanced typography, CMYK colors, ICC color profiles and PDF export, which makes it a professional solution for designers working on print projects. With a clean, organized interface, it makes a transition from InDesign relatively smooth.

**Why openSUSE?**

Besides Windows 10 expiring and having to spend more than $100 USD for an upgrade depending on the country you live in, openSUSE provides a solid environment for creative professionals to transition to a new operating system. It offers stability, security and flexibility that allows users to customize their systems to fit their specific needs. Tumbleweed, which is openSUSE’s rolling release version, ensures access to the latest versions of creative software, while the Leap version offers long-term stability with fewer updates; Leap is ideal for users who prefer to avoid frequent changes.

With software centers and tools like openSUSE’s YaST configuration tool, managing software and updates are incredibly easy; this can be a big advantage for those new to Linux.

Creative professionals can continue producing high-quality work without the need for expensive software subscriptions or hardware upgrades. From GIMP and Inkscape to Blender and Ardour, the open-source Linux ecosystem offers powerful, free alternatives that rival commercial counterparts.

The "Upgrade to Freedom!" campaign is here to help creative people make the switch. By choosing openSUSE, you not only gain access to a suite of professional-grade tools but also extend the life of your hardware and avoid contributing to e-waste.

Now is the perfect time for creative professionals to embrace the freedom of open-source software and continue thriving on Linux.

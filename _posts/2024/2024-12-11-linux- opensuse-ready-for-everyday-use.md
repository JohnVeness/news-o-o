**The [Upgrade to Freedom](https://news.opensuse.org/category/upgrade-to-freedom) campaign has joined the [End of 10](https://endof10.org) initiative to promote Free and Open Source Software as a sustainable alternative to Windows 10. Learn more at [endof10.org](https://endof10.org).**

Most people don’t give much thought to their operating system, but with Windows 10 support ending in October 2025, many will start searching for alternatives that keep them secure without spending more than $100 for a software upgrade or on hardware that still works perfectly. 

User-friendly Linux distribution like [openSUSE](https://www.get.opensuse.org/) and others offer an excellent solution for everyday tasks like social media, video conferencing, web browsing and more.

If you're a casual computer user wondering whether you can accomplish the same tasks on [Linux](https://www.kernel.org/) that you’ve been doing on Windows, the answer is a resounding YES! 

From messaging apps like Telegram to video conferencing with Zoom, openSUSE has you covered. This guide will show you how easy it is to get started with Linux and continue using the apps and tools you're familiar with.

**Get the below applications as a [Flatpak](https://flathub.org/) in the software center** of your desktop environment. 

### Web Browsing: Chrome, Firefox, Brave, and More

Browsing the web on Linux is just as simple as it is on Windows or macOS. openSUSE supports a wide range of web browsers, including some of the most popular names in the market.

- **Mozilla Firefox** comes pre-installed with most Linux distributions, including openSUSE. It's fast, privacy-focused, and supports all major web standards, making it perfect for everything from casual browsing to online shopping and video streaming.
- **Google Chrome** is available on Linux and can be installed easily on openSUSE. If you’re used to Chrome’s features, including syncing bookmarks and settings across devices, you’ll feel right at home.
- **Brave** is another great option for privacy-conscious users. It blocks trackers and ads by default and gives people a fast and secure browsing experience. Brave is also easy to install on openSUSE.
All these browsers support extensions and features you’re already familiar with, so switching to Linux won’t feel like a big leap.

### Social Media Apps: Telegram, Discord, and More

Staying connected on social media is easy, especially getting your favorite apps for messaging, video calls and group chats. Whether as a native downloadable app or as Flatpak app, you will hardly know a difference. 

- **Telegram** is available for Linux and can be installed directly from the openSUSE software repositories. It works just like the version you’re used to. It allows you to chat, make voice calls and share media with your contacts.
- **Discord**, a popular platform for gamers and communities, this also works seamlessly on Linux. You can download the Linux version from the Discord website or install it as a Flatpak for easy updates. Whether you’re chatting with friends or joining online communities, Discord on openSUSE is just as powerful as its Windows counterpart.
- **Signal**, a privacy-focused messaging app, is available for Linux and ensures that your chats are secure with end-to-end encryption. It’s a great alternative to WhatsApp for privacy-conscious users.

### Video Conferencing: Zoom and Alternatives

Video conferencing has become a staple for work and personal use, and openSUSE has strong support for popular platforms like Zoom and others.

- **Zoom** offers a Linux version that works just like the Windows app. You can download it from Zoom’s official website or use the Flatpak version. Whether you’re attending work meetings, online classes or virtual hangouts with friends, Zoom on openSUSE is fully functional and reliable.
 
- **Jitsi Meet** is a free, open-source alternative to Zoom that doesn’t require any installation. You can use it directly from your web browser. The project even uses it for its online [bar](https://meet.opensuse.org/bar) making it a quick and easy option for video conferencing without the need for additional software. Visit the [openSUSE Bar](https://meet.opensuse.org/bar) and the may be some people there ready to explain how easy it is to move to Linux.
- **Google Meet** and **Microsoft Teams** are also fully supported on Linux via web browsers like Chrome or Firefox, so you can join meetings without any issues. There is even an unofficial Flatpak app for Teams.

### Email: Thunderbird, Evolution, and More

Managing your email is easy through the browser or on with several great apps to choose from.

- **Mozilla Thunderbird** is a popular email client that comes pre-installed on many Linux distributions, including openSUSE. It supports multiple email accounts, calendars and task management, which makes it great for everyday use.
- **Evolution** is another feature-rich email client that supports Microsoft Exchange, Google accounts, and more. It’s an option if you need advanced email, calendar, and task management features.
- **Gmail**, **Outlook**, and other web-based email services are fully accessible via your preferred browser, just as they are on Windows.

### Streaming and Multimedia: Spotify, VLC and More

Linux supports popular platforms for streaming music, videos and other media.

- **Spotify** has an official Linux client that you can install on openSUSE. It works the same as it does on other operating systems, giving you access to your playlists, podcasts and favorite music.
- **VLC Media Player** is the go-to app for playing virtually any media file. Whether you're watching movies, TV shows or home videos, VLC’s powerful playback features make it a top choice on a Linux distribution.
- **YouTube** and other streaming services, such as Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+, are fully supported on Linux via web browsers like Chrome or Firefox.

### File Sharing and Cloud Storage: Dropbox, Google Drive, and Nextcloud

Managing your files and cloud storage is simple on openSUSE.
- **Nextcloud** is a popular open-source alternative to commercial cloud storage services. It allows you to host your own cloud storage solution, giving you full control over your files.
- **Dropbox** has a Linux client that integrates seamlessly with your desktop and allows you to sync files just as you would on Windows or macOS.
- **Google Drive** can be accessed through the web browser.

### How to Install

Users transitioning from Windows 10 to openSUSE should know it has the same functionality for common tasks like browsing, messaging, video conferencing, and media streaming, but without the need for expensive hardware and software upgrades. Here is an easy step-by-step guide to downloading software on your openSUSE Linux distribution:

#### KDE Plasma: Using Discover Software Center

KDE Plasma's default software center is called **Discover**, which provides an easy way to search for and install applications.

#### GNOME: Using GNOME Software Center

GNOME's default software center is called **GNOME Software**, which functions similarly to an app store.

**GNOME Step 1: Open GNOME Software**
1. Click on **Activities** in the top-left corner of your screen.
2. Type **Software** in the search bar, and click on **GNOME Software** to open it.

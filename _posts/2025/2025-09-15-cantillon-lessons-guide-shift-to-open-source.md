Communities, governments and businesses face a choice that carries real economic weight as Microsoft winds down support for its Windows 10 operating system.

This choice relates to centuries-old economic realities.

The 18th-century economist [Richard Cantillon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Cantillon) noted that when new money enters the economy, it benefits those closest to the source first while others face rising costs. Today, purchases of proprietary software echo this theory in a similar way. Vendors and shareholders profit early, while taxpayers and communities shoulder the burden of recurring fees, upgrade costs, and discarded hardware.

Switching to Linux distributions like [openSUSE](https://get.opensuse.org/) reverses this imbalance. Instead of sending public money to distant corporations, funds stay local and support IT jobs for regional developers and entrepreneurs. The use of open-source Linux distributions also extends the life of existing hardware and reduces e-waste, which proprietary models can exploit for unnecessary spending.

[Free Software Foundation Europe’s](https://fsfe.org/) [Public Money, Public Code](https://publiccode.eu/en/) campaign makes the case clearly; open code ensures transparency, prevents lock-in, and strengthens digital sovereignty. Switzerland has already enshrined this principle in law through its [Federal Law on the Use of Electronic Means for the Fulfilment of Governmental Tasks (EMBAG)](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2023/682/de), which reflects its federalist tradition of governance. Other countries are pursuing similar measures and it signals a clear shift toward legally ensuring openness and local control in publicly funded software.

The approaching [end of Windows 10](https://endof10.org/) is a clear chance for people and administrations to make smarter choices for their communities. For individuals, that means installing a Linux distribution instead of enriching distant shareholders. For governments, it means avoiding dependence on foreign corporations and preserving digital sovereignty by keeping control of critical infrastructure. Digital sovereignty increasingly depends on open-source software, yet open hardware will soon play a role in securing digital independence.
The [Endof10](https://endof10.org/) movement backed by several Linux communities has events for those willing to install open-source distributions like  [openSUSE](https://get.opensuse.org/) and others. The [great migration](https://youtu.be/q9y84viC9rY?si=G7h4uaYfLyblkqs_) is upon us and  [switching to Linux](https://youtu.be/2HHle_OmqRE?si=j5VmyNz8Hh68ZIEJ) it’s an economic and cultural decision that will keep money, skills, and control within communities rather than flowing to global software monopolies.

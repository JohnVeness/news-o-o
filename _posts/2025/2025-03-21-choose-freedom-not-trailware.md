**The [Upgrade to Freedom](https://news.opensuse.org/category/upgrade-to-freedom) campaign has joined the [End of 10](https://endof10.org) initiative to promote Free and Open Source Software as a sustainable alternative to Windows 10. Learn more at [endof10.org](https://endof10.org).**

A few weeks ago, a customer walked into a [Best Buy](https://www.bestbuy.com/), which is a well-known retailer in North America that sells computers, appliances and gadgets of all kinds.

On a mission to buy a new laptop for a family member, the customer sought something simple, reliable and future-proof. After browsing through the selection, a solid [Lenovo](https://www.lenovo.com) laptop stood out; it had good hardware, decent battery life and no unnecessary gimmicks.

As the customer approached the checkout and began paying for the new laptop, the salesperson turned and asked an unexpected question:

**“Would you like to prepay for Windows?”**

The customer blinked in surprise.

**“These computers you are displaying don’t include Windows?”**

**“No,”** the salesperson responded. **“Windows comes with a 30-day trial offer.”**

Without hesitation, the customer responded firmly:

**“Absolutely not. I’m putting Linux on it.”**

The salesperson hesitated, as if hearing this statement for the first time.

What many people don’t realize is that in certain regions, antitrust laws require manufacturers to sell computers with an option not to preinstall Windows. This is a response to decades of monopolistic practices, where users were forced to pay for a Microsoft license whether they wanted it or not. Some manufacturers have introduced Linux-preinstalled models or “no OS” options, though these remain relatively niche. In regions without such regulations, like the U.S., Windows-free computers are still uncommon outside of specialized retailers and business contracts.

Some stores (depending on the country) are legally required to offer a refund for the cost of the Windows license if the customer chooses not to use it. This is, however, rarely advertised. Many people don’t even know they have a choice or that there is a choice for freedom.

For a new laptop, install a Linux distribution like [openSUSE’s](https://get.opensuse.org/) [Leap](https://get.opensuse.org/leap/), [Slowroll](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Slowroll), [Tumbleweed](https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/), [Kalpa](https://kalpadesktop.org/), [Aeon](https://aeondesktop.org) or others.

## What You Can Do ##

If you’re in the market for a new computer, don’t let the assumption of Windows dictate your purchase. Here’s how you can take control of your computing experience:

- **Ask for a non-Windows option**: Many stores don’t advertise it, but some models are available without a preinstalled OS.
- **Request a Windows refund**: If your country has consumer protection laws, you might be entitled to a refund for the Windows license if you don’t use it.
- **Download and install openSUSE**: Head to get.opensuse.org and choose the version that best fits your needs. Leap for long-term stability or Tumbleweed for the latest rolling updates.
- **Enjoy a system without restrictions**: No licensing fees, no activation headaches, and no locked-down software.

Linux has always been there, unlocked and ready to go.

So the next time you walk into a store looking for a new computer, remember; you have a choice. And that choice can be freedom.

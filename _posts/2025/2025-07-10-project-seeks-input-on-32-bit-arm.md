The [openSUSE Project](https://get.opensuse.org/) is seeking [community input](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/project@lists.opensuse.org/thread/BTYP5CFCKBH67W73CMJQNSZ76RNC2KWB/) to determine whether it should continue supporting 32-bit [ARM](https://www.arm.com/) architectures.

Maintaining support for legacy platforms is increasingly challenging. The openSUSE team cited limited upstream support and dwindling maintenance resources as key factors behind the potential decision to retire 32-bit ARM ([ARMv6 and ARMv7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family)) support.

Devices like the [Raspberry Pi 1](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-1-model-b-plus/) , [Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero/), [BeagleBone](https://www.beagleboard.org), and other older embedded boards rely on 32-bit ARM. If you're using openSUSE on any of these platforms, the team wants to hear from you.

Take the survey at [survey.opensuse.org](https://survey.opensuse.org/) to help the team determine a path for 32-bit [ARM](https://www.arm.com/) architectures.

The survey will go until the end of July.

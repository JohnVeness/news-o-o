[Europe’s first federated AI initiative](https://www.einpresswire.com/article/829005610/europe-launches-its-first-federated-ai-factory-based-on-a-sovereign-multi-cloud-infrastructure) has chosen [openSUSE](https://get.opensuse.org/) as part of its foundation aimed sovereign AI.

OpenNebula Systems officially announced the launch of [Fact8ra](https://fact8ra.ai/), which is Europe’s first federated AI-as-a-Service platform. 

This initiative marks a major milestone under of a €3 billion [Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI)](https://competition-policy.ec.europa.eu/state-aid/ipcei_en) on [Next Generation Cloud Infrastructure and Services (IPCEI-CIS)](https://competition-policy.ec.europa.eu/state-aid/ipcei/approved-ipceis/cloud_en). 

“Fact8ra is able to combine computing resources from eight EU Member States,” according to the [press release on July 9](https://www.einpresswire.com/article/829005610/europe-launches-its-first-federated-ai-factory-based-on-a-sovereign-multi-cloud-infrastructure).

Those states are France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, and Sweden where Fact8ra aims to deliver sovereign, open source AI capabilities across Europe’s High Performance Computing (HPC), cloud and telco infrastructure.

The technology of openSUSE, which is a global open-source project sponsored by [SUSE](https://www.suse.com/), was selected as a core component of Fact8ra’s sovereign AI stack. 

The validation by one of Europe’s largest public-private cloud projects is a credit to the trust in openSUSE’s stability, adaptability and openness. It can be used not only for server-grade applications but also for advanced AI/ML workloads.

The stack not only incorporates openSUSE, but other European open source technologies such as [OpenNebula](https://opennebula.io/) and [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/), according to the release.

The platform enables deployment of private instances of open source large language models (LLMs), including [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/) and [EuroLLM](https://eurollm.io/), while offering native integration with external catalogs like [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/). 

The inclusion of [openSUSE](https://get.opensuse.org/) with [Fact8ra](https://fact8ra.ai/) is more than a technical choice, it’s a strategic endorsement. 

Fact8ra’s mission centers on European technological sovereignty and reducing dependence on foreign platforms for AI innovation. 

The operating system’s ability to support cloud-native environments, container orchestration with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), and hardware acceleration tools for AI inference has earned it a place in one of the EU’s most ambitious digital projects to date.

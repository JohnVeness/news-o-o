The [openSUSE.Asia Summit 2025](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSAS25) will take place from August 29 to 31 at MRIIRS in Faridabad, India, and we’re excited to welcome community members from across Asia and around the globe.

To make the summit more accessible, the [Travel Support Program (TSP)](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Travel_Support_Program) is available to assist participants who may need financial support to attend. Funded by the [Geeko Foundation](https://geekos.org/), the TSP helps cover some of the travel expenses presenters might incur with traveling to the summit. 

If you’re attending the summit and need support, submit your TSP application no later than July 31.

Users are stepping forward to share how Linux distributions like [openSUSE](https://get.opensuse.org/) power their projects or interests as users in the community prepare for the next enduring release of [openSUSE Leap](https://get.opensuse.org/leap).

Releases like [Leap 16](https://get.opensuse.org/leap) can be used for aviation tracking and it is one of several use cases for the distribution.

“I’ve been feeding data since 2018 to FlightRadar24, and a few years ago I started sending to OpenSky Network and Plane Finder,” wrote one openSUSE user on the [project’s mailing list](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/project@lists.opensuse.org/thread/6EL3OTP7V7EKS5QZ35U6SSHY4Y6GCYJ7/). “My average distance is around 170 nautical miles.”

In the Mississippi Delta, the user, Malcolm, uses openSUSE as the backbone of these high-tech air traffic monitoring systems. 

[FlightRadar24](https://www.flightradar24.com/), [OpenSky Network](https://opensky-network.org/) and [Plane Finder](https://planefinder.net/) collect and share real-time aircraft data from [ADS-B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Dependent_Surveillance%E2%80%93Broadcast) receivers worldwide, which allows users to track flights on interactive maps. 

Using a stick PC with an [Intel Celeron J4125](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/197305/intel-celeron-processor-j4125-4m-cache-up-to-2-70-ghz/specifications.html) processor, a 26-inch ADS-B antenna, filters and amplifiers, and openSUSE’s reliability, Malcolm tracks more than 2,000 aircraft a day.

The setup runs with x86_64 hardware, while a [Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/) doubles as a GPS time server, keeping the system and local network synchronized. The [systemd](https://github.com/systemd/systemd) services manage the various software packages provided by the tracking networks. Leap’s stability and enduring maintenance and security provide users with an ideal distribution to deploy and enjoy.

Stories like this highlight the use cases that will shape Leap 16’s rollout. The distribution, which bridges community-driven development and enterprise-grade readiness, is expected to serve an even wider range of scenarios. From IoT devices and lab environments to production servers and specialized hobbyist setups, Leap 16 marks the start of a new lifecycle plan for the distribution.

Members of the openSUSE Project are trying to showcase how people use openSUSE or are planning to Leap. If you have a  use cases for Leap 16 that you want to share, comment on the [project’s mailing list](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/project@lists.opensuse.org/thread/6EL3OTP7V7EKS5QZ35U6SSHY4Y6GCYJ7/).

People can leave feedback on [survey.opensuse.org](https://survey.opensuse.org/) regarding the release of Leap 16.

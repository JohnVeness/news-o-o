[Leap 16](https://get.opensuse.org/leap) now accepts contributions exclusively via [the new git workflow](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Packaging_for_Leap). This shift reflects a broader trend: many development projects in the Open Build Service have already adopted Git, and new ones are being onboarded daily.

[Tumbleweed](https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed)  has not yet switched to the new Git workflow. The openSUSE release team is evaluating the new staging to ensure it can scale effectively as we need to make sure that pre-intergration acceptance testing remains effective to handle up to 1,500 submissions a week.

Leap 16.0 is near the end of its development. Since there are few submissions expected per week until its release, simplified pre-integration workflow is less of a concern as that of Tumbleweed's weekly submissions. We wanted to avoid having two different systems for managing sources in Leap 16 and to ensure git adoption in its first release. 

The transition to Git should be completed by the end of the year. Once scaling concerns are addressed, Tumbleweed is expected to fully adopt Git as well. Developers can reach out to the [factory mailing](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/) list if they have any questions.

This blog is meant to help contributors understand the shift to a Git-based workflow in both Leap and Tumbleweed, so they can align their packaging practices and people are encouraged to read the Documentation on the [Git Packaging Workflow](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Git_Packaging_Workflow).

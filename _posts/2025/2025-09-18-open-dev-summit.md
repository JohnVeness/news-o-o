The [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) community will have an [Open Developers Summit](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/ODS26) on April 23, 2026, in Prague, Czech Republic.

The summit will be on the last day of [SUSECON](https://www.suse.com/susecon/), which is April 21 - 23, 2026. Members of the project invite partners of [SUSE](https://www.suse.com), openSUSE contributors, open-source community projects and enthusiasts to take part. 

Organizers are calling for proposals from those interested in presenting at the one-day event.

The call for papers is open until Feb. 14, 2026. 

Two talks formats will be available:

- **Short Talk**: 15 minutes
- **Standard Talk**: 30 minutes

Accepted talks will highlight open-source software, operating systems, new technologies, cloud, infrastructure, edge, IoT, AI, data, toolchains, security, DevOps, hardware, performance and more.

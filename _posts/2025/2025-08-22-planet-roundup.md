This is a roundup of articles from the openSUSE community listed on [planet.opensuse.org](https://planet.opensuse.org).


The below featured highlights listed on the community’s blog feed aggregator from August 16 to 22. Some of the most recent blogs involve updates on Tumbleweed developments, KDE and an [extension of the Call for Hosts for the 2026 openSUSE.Asia Summit](https://news.opensuse.org/2025/08/16/osas-cfh-extended/).

**Here is a summary and links for each post:**

## [openSUSE Welcome Receiving Makeover](https://news.opensuse.org/2025/08/21/os-welcome-makeover/)

The familiar opensuse-welcome-launcher is being phased out in favor of a new openSUSE-welcome greeter. Instead of relying on its own autostart, the greeter will coordinate desktop-specific greeters like [gnome-tour](https://github.com/openSUSE/gnome-tour) and [plasma-welcome](https://github.com/KDE/plasma-welcome). This approach allows welcome screens to appear not only on first boot but also after major updates and will help the project retire its legacy Qt5-based greeter.

A look at the newly announced DeepSeek V3.1 model from the Chinese AI startup.

The release highlights the growing pressure on OpenAI and Anthropic as DeepSeek continues its fast-paced, cost-efficient development strategy.

The [openSUSE Conference 2025](https://events.opensuse.org/) in Nuremberg from June 26 - 28 is shaping up to be a great gathering for the open source software community. 

There are three packed days of presentations, workshops and discussion along with three keynotes.

This year’s conference features SUSE CEO Dirk-Peter van Leeuwen who will recognize the [openSUSE community’s 20-year journey](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSC25/program/proposals/5038). Peer Heinlein, who founded the Heinlein Group, which includes companies like [Heinlein Support](https://www.heinlein-support.de/), [mailbox.org](https://mailbox.org/en/), [OpenTalk](https://opentalk.eu/en), and [OpenCloud](https://opencloud.eu), will provide another keynote on the same day and his talk will focus on [the risks users face when using proprietary software](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSC25/program/proposals/4984). Another keynote from [Tropic Square’s](https://github.com/tropicsquare) CEO Jan Pleskač will spotlight the growing need to [extend open source hardware](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSC25/program/proposals/4998).

The conference is offering a broad look at where openSUSE is heading and what challenges are emerging for the project’s development and how the open-source communities can resolve them. 

There are several sessions drawing attention like [“Public Money? Public Code!”](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSC25/program/proposals/4949) and [a series of presentations](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSC25/program/proposals/5029) addressing [Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_Resilience_Act) and [Network and Information Security 2 Directive (NIS2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber-security_regulation) readiness. These sessions explored how European cybersecurity regulations are impacting small to medium open-source vendors and what steps are needed to align with the evolving legal landscape.

On the technical side, integration and automation sessions continue. One talk demonstrated how [Uyuni can be tightly woven into existing infrastructure management tools](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSC25/program/proposals/4971) like Ansible and Terraform. Another session unveiled a tool called container-snap, a prototype designed to bring atomic OS updates through [OCI images](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSC25/program/proposals/5009), which helps eliminate the risk of broken upgrades.

The [Leap 16.0 Beta](https://news.opensuse.org/2025/04/30/leap-16-enters-beta/) will have a dedicated session, and the future of SUSE Linux Enterprise will be discussed in a talk titled [“From ALP to SLES16”](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSC25/program/proposals/4991). 

[Workshops on LLMs](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSC25/program/proposals/4967) will show how to run large language models locally and turn them into functional agents and a popular penguin AI project called [Kowalski](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSC25/program/proposals/5033) should capture some attention at the conference.

Underlying many talks is a shared urgency around user empowerment. The [“End of 10 Install Workshop”](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSC25/program/proposals/5035) sessions are aimed at encouraging users to install openSUSE on aging or repurposed hardware based on Microsoft’s end-of-life date for Windows 10.

The full schedule of the openSUSE Conference 2025 is available at [events.opensuse.org](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSC25/schedule).

Contributors and community members are encouraged to celebrate the [openSUSE Project’s](https://www.opensuse.org/) 20th anniversary by sharing some of their favorite moments from the past two decades. 

Over the years, it has grown into a global movement, powering desktops, servers and development environments across the open source world. 

To celebrate the project’s vibrant history, we are collecting photos from across the globe that capture the spirit of the project from conferences and hackathons to community meetups, swag collections and personal milestones.

Members are encouraged to submit up to 20 images [drop file](https://demacloud.ocloud.de/index.php/s/n7qRFTarEy2dit2). Submissions will be used in presentations showcasing the 20th anniversary and shared amongst members of the community. 

People are encouraged to celebrate something in their town or locally and share their [photos](https://demacloud.ocloud.de/index.php/s/n7qRFTarEy2dit2) to news and presentations.

Community members are encouraged to present the 20-year history of the project at conferences and summits. A presentation using the images will be made available on the [openSUSE Wiki](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Presentations). 

Members are also encouraged to celebrate the 20th Anniversary on August 9 in the [openSUSE bar](https://meet.opensuse.org/bar) where members can reminisce with others in the global community. 

During the [openSUSE.Asia Summit](https://events.opensuse.org/), there will be a quiz to win [20th Anniversary t-shirts](https://shop.opensuse.org/).
 
This is a celebration of the people who have made openSUSE what it is today. It's an accomplishment that happened through seasoned and new contributors along with passionate users. Every photo tells a piece of our shared story. 

High-resolution images are appreciated and a minimum 300 dpi resolution image is ideal.

The openSUSE Project was launched on August 9, 2005. 

Anyone having group photos at openSUSE Conferences are asked to email them to <ddemaio@opensuse.org>

# Deadline Extended: Call for Host – openSUSE.Asia Summit 2026


The openSUSE.Asia Summit Organizing Committee has extended the deadline for the Call for Host to submit proposals for the **2026 Summit**. Communities now have until **August 20, 2025** to apply.

The extension comes in response to requests from local communities seeking more time to prepare their proposals. This is a great opportunity to showcase your region and bring the openSUSE community together in your city.

The selected proposals will be presented during **openSUSE.Asia Summit 2025** in **Faridabad from August 29–30**. Proposals can be **presented online** if on-site participation is not possible.

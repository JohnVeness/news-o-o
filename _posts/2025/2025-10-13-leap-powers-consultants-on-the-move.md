For tech consultants, life happens on the move.

From airport lounges to boardrooms across Europe and beyond, the tool of choice for one tech consultant is [Slimbook Executive edition](https://slimbook.com/en/executive) powered by  [openSUSE Leap](https://get.opensuse.org/leap); it’s a reliable, secure, and flexible Linux machine that seamlessly adapts to the ever-changing demands of independent consulting.

Freelancer tech consultants like Agustín Benito Bethencourt, who shared his use case of Leap, works with multiple clients in highly regulated industries face unique challenges as each customer enforces its own security policies, communication platforms,and compliance protocols. 

What works for one organization might be blocked or noncompliant with another.

Leap’s flexibility allows Bethencourt and his consultant company, [toscalix](http://www.toscalix.com), to adapt quickly. As an independent consultant, Bethencourt needs to use many of the video chat tools available. This includes [BigBlueButton](https://bigbluebutton.org/) and [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/) through the web, plus Google Meet, [Zoom](https://flathub.org/en/apps/us.zoom.Zoom), Teams and [Slack](https://flathub.org/en/apps/com.slack.Slack).

Bethencourt uses [Firefox](https://flathub.org/en/apps/org.mozilla.firefox), [Edge](https://flathub.org/en/apps/com.microsoft.Edge) and [Chromium/Chrome](https://flathub.org/en/apps/com.google.Chrome) because different corporate tools are necessary. 

“Some of these tools, I use them through Flatpaks,” Bethencourt said. 

[Flatpaks](https://flatpak.org/) are containerized applications designed to run consistently on any Linux distribution and can be found through [Flathub](https://flathub.org/en).

The consultant’s workflow goes beyond applications. Different customers impose strict security measures, from encrypted drives and segregated vaults to VPNs tied to specific certificates. The consultant uses [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) as a password manager with separate vaults for each client and it reduces risks of accidental data exposure.

Hardware-level protections also play a role. A patch disables the laptop’s webcam when visiting customer facilities. When charging in airports or on-site, the consultant uses [USB data blockers](https://www.amazon.es/-/en/MMOBIEL-Blocker-Protection-Against-Hacking/dp/B0D9YSCP35?th=1) to prevent [juice jacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juice_jacking) attacks, which is a type of attack that exploits USB cables to secretly transfer data while charging.

Bethencourt explained that compiling the information into a document might streamline interactions with security compliance departments. 

“My use case might not be fancy,” he said. But “it shows the flexibility from a professional user’s point of view.” 

Stories like this illustrate Leap’s adaptability for diverse environments. With [Leap 16’s extended lifecycle](https://news.opensuse.org/2025/09/03/leap-16-doubles-support/) and enterprise-grade reliability, professionals can count on this distribution whether they are in the office, in transit or on-site with a client.

Members of the openSUSE Project are trying to showcase how people use openSUSE or are planning to Leap. If you have a  use cases for Leap 16 that you want to share, comment on the [project’s mailing list](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/project@lists.opensuse.org/thread/6EL3OTP7V7EKS5QZ35U6SSHY4Y6GCYJ7/).

### Install Linux Before It's Too Late
The [openSUSE Project](https://get.opensuse.org/) is part of a growing coalition of open-source advocates urging Microsoft users to install a Linux operating system as Microsoft prepares to end support for Windows 10 this October, and urgency to get that message out is building.

Some in the [IT industry](https://www.controlup.com/windows-11-readiness/#) are suggesting that as many as 50 percent of the devices remain using Windows 10, which comes at great risk to users and businesses.

Those who remain on Windows 10 and don’t upgrade to an operating system providing security and maintenance updates like a Linux OS or Window 11 will be susceptible to vulnerabilities, malware infections, software incompatibilities, and an increasing amount of system instability and failures over time.

The [End of 10](https://endof10.org/) campaign and its initiative aims to promote migration-focused type [events](https://endof10.org/events/) to help these users shift from Windows 10 to Linux-based operating systems.

The amount of PCs that will become unprotected on October 14 is unprecedented, and getting people to migrate to Linux operating systems like [openSUSE’s](https://get.opensuse.org/) is reaching a critical juncture as millions face the looming deadline this Fall. 

October 14 is just 12 weeks away and the end-of-support deadline for Windows 10 will expose those who have not migrated to increasing cyber threats.

In additions to the the threats, a big part of the [End of 10](https://endof10.org/) movement emphasizes environmental responsibility, digital sustainability and long-term cost savings for those with aging computers that could potentially end up [recycled or in landfill](https://news.opensuse.org/2025/04/14/replace-windows-not-your-device/).

[End of 10](https://endof10.org/) advocates and supporting organizations like [NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com/), [REPAIR CAFE](https://www.repaircafe.org/), [KDE](https://kde.org/), [GNOME](https://gnome.org/), [FSFE](https://fsfe.org/), [EU OS](https://eu-os.eu/) and several other organizations would prefer users find a Linux solution for their older hardware rather than have this event create an environmental disaster. Installing Linux on these old systems can breathe new life into perfectly functional machines that may otherwise be discarded.

Several open-source software projects and organizations and been collaborating for more than a year to create unified resources, tutorials, migration tools and support channels to help lower the barrier to entry for those who seek to install a Linux new operating system.

Members of the openSUSE community and others have been vocal about appealing to [Windows 10 users that can’t upgrade their devices to Windows 11](https://news.opensuse.org/2024/11/20/upgrade-to-freedom-the-switch-from-windows/).

For those ready to act, the [campaign website](https://endof10.org/) has resources available and links to community events to help people install Linux. 

Anyone who wants to install an [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) distribution can follow this [A Step-by-Step Guide](https://news.opensuse.org/2024/11/26/transition-from-windows-step-by-step/). 

The message to Windows 10 users is clear; don’t replace your computer; reimagine it!

The [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) community wants to make the projectâ€™s [conference](https://events.opensuse.org/) in Nuremberg smooth, welcoming and beneficial to attendees. Weâ€™re calling on you to get involved!

Whether youâ€™re a longtime contributor or a new face looking to get more involved, there are several ways you can support the conference and ensure everyone has a good time.

## We Need Volunteers for:

### ðŸŸ¢ Registration Booth / Welcome Desk  
Be the first friendly face attendees see! Help us greet participants, hand out badges and swag, and answer basic questions about the venue and schedule.

### ðŸŸ¢ Timekeeping During Talks  
Help keep our sessions running on time by signaling to speakers when theyâ€™re approaching the end of their allotted time. This simple task helps ensure everyone gets a fair and punctual presentation slot.

### ðŸŸ¢ Shop Assistance  
Weâ€™ll have [a shop set up at the venue](https://news.opensuse.org/2025/05/06/get-gear-at-osc/) with openSUSE merchandise available for purchase. Volunteers will help the booth lead organize inventory and assist with transactions.

### ðŸŸ¢ Video Team Support  
The video team could use extra hands with camera setup on June 25 and session recordings through the conference as well as stream monitoring. No prior experience required; just a willingness to help and learn.

Those who are interested should email [ddemaio@opensuse.org](mailto:ddmaio@opensuse.org?subject=oSC25 Help) with the subject header oSC25 Help.

## Spreading Awareness â€“ Celebrating 20 Years of openSUSE

This year marks 20 years of openSUSE, and we're working on a special video project to honor the people and stories behind the project. As part of this, we're running a campaign at the conference to highlight how individuals contribute to openSUSE. Whether itâ€™s packaging, translation, infrastructure, design, community organizing, release management or documentation, we would like for you to spend a few minutes on camera. 

If youâ€™d like to help capture these stories or support the video teamâ€™s work to showcase them, weâ€™d love to hear from you. Send an email to [ddemaio@opensuse.org](mailto:ddmaio@opensuse.org?subject=openSUSE 20 Year!) with the subject header openSUSE 20 Year!

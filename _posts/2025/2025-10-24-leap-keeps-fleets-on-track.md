Every minute matters for companies managing vehicle fleets and Linux distributions like  [openSUSE’s](https://get.opensuse.org/leap) serve as dependable backbones for these types of operations.

From security patrols in Indonesia to maintenance cars in the Philippines, fleets can be monitored in real time through cloud-based platforms powered by [openSUSE Leap](https://get.opensuse.org/leap) like [Ntrack’s](https://ntrack.id/) GPS Vehicle Tracking System.

Releases like [Leap 16](https://get.opensuse.org/leap) can be used for GPS Vehicle Tracking list this and is one of several use cases for the distribution.

The vehicle tracking system processes raw data from third-party GPS IoT devices made by companies like [Teltonika](https://www.teltonika-gps.com/), [Concox](https://www.iconcox.com/), [Atrack](https://www.atrack.com.tw/en) and others. Each unit sends signals every minute over 3G, 4G and 5G networks, which creates a constant stream of location data. That data is queued using [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) and stored in [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) databases clustered on [Leap](https://get.opensuse.org/leap) servers.

It provides excellent support for database clustering and system monitoring, ensuring reliable failover and scalability of the data layer, said one developer who shared their use case with  the [project’s mailing list](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/project@lists.opensuse.org/thread/6EL3OTP7V7EKS5QZ35U6SSHY4Y6GCYJ7/). The system is handling 50–100 data packets per second, and openSUSE keeps it reliable.

The Ntrack platform transforms these packets into actionable insights for fleet operators. Built on Leap, it offers features like live tracking, route scheduling, driver behavior analysis, geofencing and reporting.

The developer, Edwin, said that the use cases already cover fleets across the islands of Java and Bali related to private security, telecommunications maintenance vehicles in the Philippines, and company cars throughout Indonesia.

GPS tracking systems like Ntrack are another example of how the distribution powers mission-critical applications around the world; Leap 16’s extended lifecycle provides the reliability and upgradability businesses need to trust their technology infrastructure.

Members of the openSUSE Project are trying to showcase how people use openSUSE . If you have a  use cases for Leap 16 that you want to share, comment on the [project’s mailing list](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/project@lists.opensuse.org/thread/6EL3OTP7V7EKS5QZ35U6SSHY4Y6GCYJ7/).
